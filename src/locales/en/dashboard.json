    "eii": {
      "what": "The Ethical Integrity Index (EII) is a composite score that aggregates technical compliance metrics into a single transparency measure. It ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate better ethical and technical practices.",
      "how": "EII is calculated using a weighted formula: 30% Accessibility + 30% Performance + 20% SEO + 20% Bundle Efficiency. Each category is scored from 0-100 based on industry standards and best practices.",
      "why": "A high EII demonstrates commitment to inclusive design, environmental sustainability, and user-centered development. It enables stakeholders to quickly assess the ethical maturity of web applications."
    },
    "seo": {
      "what": "SEO metrics measure how well the website follows search engine optimization best practices, including semantic HTML, meta tags, structured data, and content accessibility.",
      "how": "Scores are derived from Google Lighthouse SEO audits, which check for proper metadata, mobile-friendliness, crawlability, and schema markup.",
      "why": "Good SEO ensures equal access to information and supports content discovery for all users, including those using assistive technologies."
    },
    "a11y": {
      "what": "Accessibility metrics evaluate compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.2 Level AA), ensuring the site is usable by people with disabilities.",
      "how": "Automated testing with axe-core and Lighthouse checks for color contrast, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and semantic HTML.",
      "why": "Accessibility is a fundamental human right. WCAG compliance ensures digital inclusion for users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities."
    },
    "performance": {
      "what": "Performance metrics measure page load times, interactivity, and visual stability using Core Web Vitals and other efficiency indicators.",
      "how": "Lighthouse performance audits measure Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Total Blocking Time (TBT), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), and other timing metrics.",
      "why": "Fast, responsive websites improve user experience and reduce energy consumption. Performance directly impacts accessibility for users on slow connections or low-powered devices."
    },
    "bundle": {
      "what": "Bundle efficiency measures JavaScript code size and optimization, assessing how much data users must download to use the application.",
      "how": "Build-time analysis compares JavaScript bundle sizes against budgets (e.g., <250KB per route). Scores favor smaller bundles and effective code splitting.",
      "why": "Smaller bundles reduce bandwidth costs, load faster on slower networks, and minimize environmental impact through reduced energy consumption."
