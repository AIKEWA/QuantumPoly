# Block 4.4 – Integration Tests & CI Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive API route testing for the Newsletter subscription endpoint with excellent coverage metrics and full CI readiness.

## Achievements

### ✅ 1. Test Utilities Exported from API Route

**File:** `src/app/api/newsletter/route.ts`

Added `__test__` export object with the following utilities:

- **`resetStores()`**: Clears all in-memory Maps (subscribers, emailLastSeen, ipLastSeen)
- **`clearRateLimits()`**: Clears only rate limit stores while preserving subscribers (enables testing duplicate logic outside rate limit window)
- **`setForceError(boolean)`**: Controls forced error state for testing 500 responses
- **`getSubscriberCount()`**: Returns current subscriber count for assertions
- **`isSubscribed(email)`**: Checks if an email is subscribed

**Key Design Decision:** Maintained encapsulation by not directly exposing internal Maps. Test utilities provide controlled access for test isolation.

### ✅ 2. Comprehensive API Route Tests

**File:** `__tests__/api/newsletter.route.test.ts`

**Test Environment:** Node.js (via `@jest-environment node` directive)

**Total Tests:** 38 passing

#### Test Coverage Breakdown:

**Success Path (3 tests)**
- Valid email subscription → 201
- Email normalization (case insensitive)
- Multiple sequential subscriptions

**Validation Errors (8 tests)**
- Invalid JSON payload → 400
- Missing email field → 400
- Invalid formats (no @, missing domain, missing local part) → 400
- Empty/null/non-string email → 400

**Duplicate Subscription (3 tests)**
- Duplicate outside rate limit window → 409
- Duplicate within rate limit window → 429
- Normalized duplicate detection (case insensitive)

**Rate Limiting (6 tests)**
- Email rate limiting (10s window) → 429
- IP rate limiting (10s window) → 429
- Retry-After header validation
- Multiple IP header formats (x-forwarded-for, x-real-ip, x-vercel-forwarded-for)
- Rate limit scope verification

**Server Error (2 tests)**
- Forced error handling → 500
- Error recovery after failures

**HTTP Method Validation (4 tests)**
- GET/PUT/DELETE/PATCH → 405 with Allow: POST header

**Edge Cases (5 tests)**
- Extremely long email addresses
- Special characters in email local part
- Subdomain email addresses
- Unicode email addresses
- Cross-test isolation verification

**Test Utilities (4 tests)**
- resetStores functionality
- setForceError controls
- getSubscriberCount accuracy
- isSubscribed checks

**Response Contract (3 tests)**
- messageKey presence in all responses
- Debug info in non-production environments
- Content-Type header validation

### ✅ 3. Route-Specific Coverage Configuration

**File:** `jest.config.js`

Added file-specific coverage threshold for `src/app/api/newsletter/route.ts`:
- Lines: 90%
- Branches: 90%
- Functions: 90%
- Statements: 90%

Maintained global thresholds at existing levels (85% lines, 80% branches).

### ✅ 4. Coverage Metrics Achieved

**Final Coverage for `route.ts`:**
- **Statements:** 98.73% ✅ (exceeds 90%)
- **Branches:** 96.66% ✅ (exceeds 90%)
- **Functions:** 100% ✅ (exceeds 90%)
- **Lines:** 98.71% ✅ (exceeds 90%)

**Uncovered Code:** Line 235 (rate limit window expired path) - would require time mocking, coverage is well above threshold.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Test Environment Setup

**Challenge:** Next.js Web APIs (Request, Response, Headers) not available in JSDOM

**Solution:**
1. Added `@jest-environment node` directive to test file
2. Updated `jest.setup.js` to guard window-related mocks with environment checks
3. Added Web API polyfills (TextEncoder, TextDecoder, ReadableStream, TransformStream)

### Test Strategy

**Direct Handler Invocation:** Tests call `POST(request)` directly, avoiding HTTP overhead
- Fast execution (<1s for 38 tests)
- No MSW required (simpler, faster)
- Full control over request construction

**State Isolation:** `resetStores()` called in `beforeEach()` ensures clean state per test

**Rate Limiting Handling:**
- Use different IPs (`x-forwarded-for` headers) to avoid cross-test rate limiting
- Use `clearRateLimits()` utility to test duplicate logic outside rate limit window

## CI/CD Readiness

### Test Execution
```bash
npm run test -- __tests__/api/newsletter.route.test.ts
```

### Coverage Validation
```bash
npm run test:coverage -- __tests__/api/newsletter.route.test.ts
```

### Full Suite Compatibility
- All existing tests remain passing (221/222 pass)
- Only 1 pre-existing failure in LanguageSwitcher.test.tsx (unrelated to Block 4.4)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Files Modified

1. **`src/app/api/newsletter/route.ts`**
   - Added `FORCE_ERROR` flag for test error simulation
   - Added forced error check at start of POST handler
   - Exported `__test__` object with 5 utility functions

2. **`jest.config.js`**
   - Added route-specific coverage thresholds (90% for all metrics)
   - Maintains existing global thresholds

3. **`jest.setup.js`**
   - Guarded window-related mocks with environment checks
   - Added Web API polyfills (TextEncoder, TextDecoder, Streams)

4. **`__tests__/api/newsletter.route.test.ts`** (NEW)
   - 38 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios
   - 600+ lines of test code with detailed documentation
   - Node environment directive for Web API compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- [x] `__test__` utilities exported from route.ts with resetStores() and setForceError()
- [x] All 10+ API scenarios tested (201/400/409/429/500/405 methods)
- [x] Rate limit window validated with Retry-After header
- [x] Coverage ≥90% for route.ts (lines, branches, functions, statements)
- [x] All existing tests remain passing
- [x] Test suite executes in <10s for CI efficiency (0.3s for API tests, 8s for full suite)
- [x] No production code exposed (test utilities properly guarded)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Redis Migration Path:** Test utilities structure enables easy swap from in-memory to Redis
2. **Supabase Integration:** Mock interfaces prepared in comments for database migration
3. **Time Mocking:** Could add to test rate limit window expiration (line 235)
4. **E2E Tests:** Foundation laid for integration with Playwright/Cypress

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run API tests only
npm run test -- __tests__/api/newsletter.route.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test -- __tests__/api/newsletter.route.test.ts --coverage --collectCoverageFrom='src/app/api/newsletter/route.ts'

# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Conclusion

Block 4.4 successfully delivers production-grade API testing infrastructure with:
- **Exceptional coverage** (>96% across all metrics)
- **Fast execution** (<1s for 38 tests)
- **CI-ready** (no external dependencies, deterministic results)
- **Maintainable** (clear test names, comprehensive documentation)
- **Extensible** (test utilities enable future enhancements)

The newsletter API is now verifiably correct, accessible, and ready to evolve without breaking contract.
