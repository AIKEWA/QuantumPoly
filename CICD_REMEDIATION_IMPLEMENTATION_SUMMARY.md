   - Verify with CLI command

2. **Monitor First CI Run**
   - Watch build job execution
   - Check SBOM artifact upload
   - Verify coverage enforcement
   - Review CI run time (should be <10 min total)

3. **Test Approval Flow**
   - Create test tag: `v0.0.1-test`

   - Verify approval prompt appears
   - Clean up test artifacts

4. **Update Team**
   - Announce new coverage requirements (85%)
   - Share SBOM policy documentation
