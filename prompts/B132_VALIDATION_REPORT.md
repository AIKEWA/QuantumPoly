# B132 Validation Report: Ethics Singularity Prompt Suite

**Date:** 2025-12-02
**Validator:** CASP Lead Architect
**Scope:** `prompts/B132-*.md`
**Objective:** Verify structural integrity, scientific traceability, and proper tagging of inferred concepts.

## 1. Summary of Changes

Five new prompt documents were generated and integrated into the `prompts/` library:

1.  `B132-OVERVIEW` (Theoretical Synthesis)
2.  `B132-ESSAY` (Academic Output)
3.  `B132-SIM` (Simulation Design)
4.  `B132-SYMPOSIUM` (Event Strategy)
5.  `B132-FRAMEWORK` (Technical Specs)

The `prompts/index.md` file was updated to include these entries under a new "Governance & Ethics (Block 13.2)" category.

## 2. Inference Audit

All conceptual extrapolations were successfully tagged with `[Inference]`. Below is a breakdown of the key inferences by file, confirming they align with the project's theoretical trajectory without hallucinating non-existent blocks.

### 2.1 Theoretical Overview (`B132-OVERVIEW`)

- **Validated:** The "Transparency-Autonomy Continuum" correctly infers that Block 3 (Transparency) is a prerequisite for Block 9 (Autonomy).
- **Validated:** The "Recursive Governance Loop" correctly extrapolates the need for meta-policies to govern operational policies.

### 2.2 Paper Generator (`B132-ESSAY`)

- **Validated:** The critique of "Constitutional AI" as insufficient without self-evolution is a sound theoretical inference.
- **Validated:** The use of "Trust Proof Framework" (Block 9.7) as a counter-argument to moral ossification is internally consistent.

### 2.3 Simulation Designer (`B132-SIM`)

- **Validated:** "Drift Tolerance" scores for agents are a logical extension of the persona simulation requirements.
- **Validated:** The "Kill Switch" (Block 10.9) is correctly identified as an external failsafe, distinct from the internal simulation physics.

### 2.4 Symposium Designer (`B132-SYMPOSIUM`)

- **Validated:** The "Turing Test for Ethics" is a novel but consistent application of the Block 9.5 module's capabilities.
- **Validated:** The "Recursive Mute Button" correctly applies Block 9.4 (Public Ethics API) to a social context.

### 2.5 Framework Docs (`B132-FRAMEWORK`)

- **Validated:** The `X-Ethics-Signature` header is a standard technical inference for cryptographic verification.
- **Validated:** The `recursionDepth` parameter is a necessary safety constraint for self-modifying code.

## 3. Cross-Reference Verification

- **Block 9.5 (Ethical Autonomy):** Referenced correctly in all files as the core engine.
- **Block 13.1 (Institutionalization):** Referenced correctly as the human interface layer.
- **Block 7.x (CI/CD):** Referenced correctly in `B132-OVERVIEW` (immutability) and `B132-FRAMEWORK` (pipeline integration).

## 4. Conclusion

The B132 prompt suite is **functionally complete** and **structurally valid**. The inferences introduced are logical extensions of the existing QuantumPoly architecture and do not contradict established axioms.

**Status:** APPROVED for immediate use.
