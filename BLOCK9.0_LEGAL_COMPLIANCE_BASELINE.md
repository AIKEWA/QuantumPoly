**Current Status:** ✅ **Zero tracking tools deployed**

The following are **NOT** currently active:
- ❌ Google Analytics
- ❌ Facebook Pixel
- ❌ Marketing cookies
- ❌ Third-party advertising scripts
- ❌ Behavioral tracking

**Future Considerations:**  
If analytics tools (e.g., Plausible Analytics, Vercel Analytics) are added in the future, a consent banner will be implemented and the Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly (Block 9.2 — Consent Management, planned Q1 2026).

---

## 6. Known Gaps and Mitigation Plan

### 6.1 P1 — Future Analytics Integration

**Status:** ⚠️ Planned  
**Description:** Currently no analytics tools are active. If added in the future, consent management is required.  
**Mitigation:** Privacy Policy includes explicit language about future extensions. Consent banner implementation planned for Block 9.2.  
**Timeline:** Q1 2026 (if analytics are added)

### 6.2 P2 — Additional Language Versions

**Status:** ⚠️ Partial  
**Description:** ES, FR, IT, TR policy versions are placeholder templates.  
**Mitigation:** DE and EN are primary legal versions. Other locales fall back to English gracefully.  
**Timeline:** Block 9.3 (Localization), Q2 2026

### 6.3 P3 — Data Protection Officer (DPO)

**Status:** ✅ Not required  
**Description:** As a Swiss sole proprietorship with minimal data processing, a formal DPO is not legally required under GDPR Art. 37 or DSG Art. 10.  
**Current Practice:** Owner (Aykut Aydin) acts as responsible person for data protection inquiries via legal@quantumpoly.ai.
