## Our Ethical Foundation

At QuantumPoly, we recognize that advanced technologies—particularly artificial intelligence—carry significant responsibilities. We are committed to developing and deploying our systems in ways that respect human dignity, promote fairness, and contribute positively to society.

This document outlines our ethical principles and transparency commitments. It is a living document that evolves as we learn and as technology advances.

## Core Ethical Principles

### Human-Centered Design

We design our systems to augment and support human capabilities, not to replace human judgment in critical decisions. Our technology serves people and respects their autonomy.

**Key commitments:**

- Systems provide clear information about their capabilities and limitations
- Users retain meaningful control over important decisions
- We prioritize accessibility and inclusive design
- Human oversight is maintained for high-stakes applications

### Fairness and Non-Discrimination

We strive to identify and mitigate biases in our systems, recognizing that technical solutions alone are insufficient without ongoing vigilance and diverse perspectives.

**Key commitments:**

- Regular audits of our systems for discriminatory outcomes
- Diverse teams involved in design, development, and testing
- Transparent documentation of known limitations
- Mechanisms for users to report concerns

### Transparency and Explainability

We believe users deserve to understand how our systems work and how decisions are made, to the extent technically feasible and appropriate.

**Key commitments:**

- Clear disclosure when users interact with AI systems
- Documentation of model capabilities, training data, and known limitations
- Accessible explanations appropriate to different audiences
- Regular public reporting on our practices

## Data Practices

### Responsible Data Use

We collect and use data responsibly, respecting privacy and obtaining appropriate consent.

**Key commitments:**

- Data minimization: collect only what is necessary
- Clear purpose specification for data collection
- Secure storage and processing
- Regular review of data retention policies

### Privacy by Design

Privacy considerations are integrated from the earliest stages of system design, not added as an afterthought.

## Safety and Security

We take proactive measures to ensure our systems are safe, secure, and robust against misuse.

**Key commitments:**

- Rigorous testing before deployment
- Continuous monitoring for unexpected behaviors
- Rapid response procedures for identified issues
- Collaboration with security researchers

## Accountability and Governance

### Internal Oversight

We maintain internal structures to ensure ethical principles are upheld throughout the organization.

**Current structures:**

- Ethics review for new projects and features
- Regular training for all team members
- Clear escalation paths for ethical concerns
- Documentation and learning from incidents

### External Engagement

We actively seek input from diverse stakeholders, including affected communities, researchers, and civil society organizations.

**Engagement mechanisms:**

- Public consultations on significant changes
- Collaboration with academic researchers
- Participation in industry-wide initiatives
- Transparent reporting of our practices and their impacts

## Continuous Improvement

We recognize that ethical AI development is an ongoing journey, not a destination. We commit to:

- Regular review and update of this policy
- Learning from mistakes and near-misses
- Staying informed about emerging best practices
- Adapting our practices as technology and understanding evolve

## Questions and Feedback

We welcome questions, concerns, and suggestions regarding our ethical practices. Please contact our Trust Team at trust@quantumpoly.ai.
