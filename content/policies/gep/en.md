## Introduction

Good Engineering Practices (GEP) define the technical standards and methodologies that guide our development work at QuantumPoly. These practices ensure quality, maintainability, security, and reliability across our systems.

This document is intended for technical teams and stakeholders who want to understand our engineering approach.

## Development Principles

### Code Quality

We maintain high standards for code quality through systematic practices and continuous review.

**Core practices:**

- Code reviews required for all changes
- Automated testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Static analysis and linting integrated into development workflow
- Clear, self-documenting code with appropriate comments
- Consistent style guides across languages and frameworks

### Version Control

We use Git-based version control with structured workflows.

**Key practices:**

- Feature branches for new development
- Protected main branches requiring reviews
- Meaningful commit messages following conventional formats
- Regular synchronization to avoid large merge conflicts
- Comprehensive change documentation

### Testing Strategy

Testing is integrated throughout the development lifecycle, not treated as an afterthought.

**Testing levels:**

- **Unit tests:** Validate individual components in isolation
- **Integration tests:** Verify interactions between components
- **End-to-end tests:** Validate complete user workflows
- **Performance tests:** Ensure systems meet performance requirements
- **Security tests:** Identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses

**Coverage targets:**

- Critical paths: 100% coverage
- Core business logic: 90%+ coverage
- UI components: 80%+ coverage

## Architecture and Design

### System Design

We follow established architectural patterns and prioritize:

- **Modularity:** Systems composed of well-defined, loosely coupled components
- **Scalability:** Ability to handle growing demands
- **Resilience:** Graceful degradation and recovery from failures
- **Observability:** Comprehensive monitoring and logging

### Documentation

Technical documentation is maintained alongside code.

**Documentation types:**

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant design choices
- API documentation with clear examples
- Setup and deployment guides
- Inline code documentation for complex logic
- Runbooks for operational procedures

## Security Practices

### Secure Development

Security is considered from the earliest stages of development.

**Key practices:**

- Threat modeling for new features
- Regular security reviews and audits
- Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Secrets management (no credentials in code)
- Principle of least privilege for system access

### Data Protection

We implement appropriate controls to protect sensitive data.

**Controls:**

- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access controls and authentication
- Data minimization and retention policies
- Regular backup and recovery testing
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Deployment and Operations

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Automated pipelines ensure consistent, reliable deployments.

**Pipeline stages:**

1. Automated testing on every commit
2. Security and quality scans
3. Staging environment deployment and validation
4. Production deployment with monitoring
5. Automated rollback capabilities

### Monitoring and Observability

We maintain comprehensive visibility into system behavior.

**Monitoring areas:**

- Application performance metrics
- Error rates and types
- Resource utilization
- User experience metrics
- Security events

### Incident Response

We maintain procedures for identifying and resolving issues quickly.

**Response process:**

1. Detection and alerting
2. Initial assessment and triage
3. Investigation and diagnosis
4. Mitigation and resolution
5. Post-incident review and learning

## Dependencies and Supply Chain

### Dependency Management

We carefully manage external dependencies to minimize risk.

**Practices:**

- Regular updates for security patches
- Vetting of new dependencies
- License compliance verification
- Monitoring for deprecation and end-of-life
- Documented reasoning for major dependencies

### Supply Chain Security

We take measures to ensure the integrity of our software supply chain.

**Measures:**

- Verified package sources
- Dependency pinning and lock files
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation
- Build reproducibility where feasible

## Performance and Efficiency

### Performance Standards

We establish and monitor performance benchmarks.

**Key metrics:**

- Response time targets
- Throughput requirements
- Resource efficiency
- User-perceived performance

### Optimization Approach

Performance optimization is data-driven and focused on user impact.

**Process:**

1. Establish baseline measurements
2. Identify bottlenecks through profiling
3. Implement targeted optimizations
4. Verify improvements
5. Monitor for regressions

## Accessibility

We build systems that are accessible to users with diverse needs and abilities.

**Commitments:**

- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance as baseline
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast and visual design considerations
- Testing with assistive technologies

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning and Adaptation

We continuously refine our practices based on experience and industry developments.

**Mechanisms:**

- Regular retrospectives
- Knowledge sharing sessions
- Post-incident reviews
- Industry research and benchmarking
- Experimentation with new tools and approaches

### Metrics and Measurement

We measure what matters and use data to guide improvements.

**Key metrics:**

- Deployment frequency
- Change failure rate
- Mean time to recovery
- Code quality indicators
- Team velocity and satisfaction
