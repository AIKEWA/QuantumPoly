# QuantumPoly Block 8: Governance Integration Session
# Created: 2025-10-24
# Status: Ready for execution

session:
  name: 'QuantumPoly Governance Integration'
  block: 8
  phase: 'Governance & Ethical Framework Integration'
  
  goals:
    - Implement GPG ledger signing system
    - Create governance dashboard interface
    - Integrate governance.yml validation into CI pipeline
    - Sync ethical ledger data with commit lifecycle
    - Establish automated transparency reports
    - Configure real-time EII (Ethical Integrity Index) tracking

  dependencies:
    - Block 7 CI/CD pipeline (✅ Complete)
    - GPG key infrastructure (⚠️ Setup required)
    - Ledger baseline (✅ Initialized)
    - Governance policies (✅ Documented)

  deliverables:
    - GPG-signed ledger entries
    - Governance dashboard UI components
    - CI workflow integration for ledger updates
    - Automated EII calculation scripts
    - Transparency report generation system
    - Governance documentation updates

  verification:
    build:
      - npm run build
      - npm run test
    
    governance:
      - scripts/verify-ledger.mjs
      - scripts/audit-sync-ledger.sh
    
    integration:
      - npm run test:integration
      - npm run test:a11y
    
    deployment:
      - vercel --prod
      - lighthouse CI validation

  success_criteria:
    - All ledger entries cryptographically signed
    - Governance dashboard accessible at /dashboard/ledger
    - CI pipeline validates governance.yml on every commit
    - EII scores tracked and visualized
    - Transparency reports auto-generated on release
    - Zero governance validation failures

  technical_stack:
    cryptography:
      - GPG/PGP for signing
      - SHA-256 for hashing
      - Merkle tree for integrity
    
    frontend:
      - React/Next.js components
      - Tailwind CSS styling
      - D3.js for visualizations
    
    backend:
      - Node.js scripts
      - JSON Lines ledger format
      - API routes for data access
    
    ci_cd:
      - GitHub Actions workflows
      - Vercel deployment hooks
      - Automated validation gates

  risk_assessment:
    - GPG key management complexity (Medium)
    - Ledger corruption if not atomically updated (High)
    - Dashboard performance with large ledger (Low)
    - Privacy concerns with public ledger (Medium)

  mitigation_strategies:
    - Use hardware security keys for GPG
    - Implement atomic file operations with backups
    - Add pagination and lazy loading to dashboard
    - Implement redaction for sensitive data fields

  timeline:
    estimated_duration: '3-5 days'
    milestones:
      - GPG infrastructure setup (Day 1)
      - Ledger signing implementation (Day 2)
      - Dashboard UI development (Day 3)
      - CI integration (Day 4)
      - Testing and documentation (Day 5)
