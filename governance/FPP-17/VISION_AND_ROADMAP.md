# FPP-17 Series: AI Autonomy & Adaptive Ethics

**Series Lead:** EWA / QuantumPoly Council  
**Start Date:** 2025-12-06  
**Status:** INITIATED (Block 17.0)

## 1. Strategic Vision

The FPP-17 series marks the transition from **Static Governance** (rule-based compliance) to **Adaptive Governance** (context-aware ethics). The goal is to empower the AI agents within the system (EWA) to propose, simulate, and conditionally execute governance updates based on real-time feedback and trust metrics.

## 2. Key Initiatives

### 2.1 Adaptive Ethics Engine (FPP-17-01)

- **Objective:** Upgrade EWA to v2.5 with "Context Awareness".
- **Features:** Real-time sentiment analysis of feedback, dynamic trust scoring, and automated alert escalation.

### 2.2 Quantum-Trust Mechanisms (FPP-17-02)

- **Objective:** Implement quantum-resistant signing for the governance ledger.
- **Features:** Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) integration for ledger entry signing.

### 2.3 The "Silent Observer" Protocol (FPP-17-03)

- **Objective:** A passive monitoring layer that audits AI decisions without interference, ensuring alignment with human values.

## 3. Roadmap

## 4. Governance & Oversight

All FPP-17 initiatives will strictly adhere to the **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** principle for any critical system changes. While autonomy is the goal, accountability remains human.
