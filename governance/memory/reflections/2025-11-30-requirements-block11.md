# Reflection: Block 11.0 Requirements Review

**Date:** 2025-11-30 (Scheduled) / 2025-11-22 (Executed)
**Subject:** Requirements Extraction for Collective AI Ethics Federation (Block 11.0)
**Participants:** EWA (System), AIK (User/Lead)

## 1. Context

The transition to Stage VII (Federated Ethics) requires a rigorous transformation of theoretical "Explanations" into engineering-ready "Requirements". This reflection captures the outcome of the extraction process performed on Block 11.0.

## 2. Key Insights

- **Meta-Governance Complexity:** The requirements highlighted significant complexity in the "Federalism Problem" — specifically, how local autonomy interacts with federal consensus.
- **Quantification Gap:** A major gap exists in translating qualitative ethical values (e.g., Stewardship) into the quantitative "Ethical Weighting Protocols" required by the system.
- **Security Rigor:** The necessity for "Verifiable Trust" mandated the inclusion of Merkle + PGP cross-signatures, elevating the cryptographic requirements beyond standard logging.

## 3. Outcomes

- **Artifact Created:** `docs/requirements/BLOCK11.0_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- **Ledger Entry:** `block11.0-requirements` added to `governance/ledger/blocks.jsonl` with SHA-256 checksum validation.
- **Validation:** Functional and Non-Functional requirements have been separated to facilitate parallel development streams (Engineering vs. Governance).

## 4. Next Actions

- **Block 11.1 Design:** Begin drafting the "Federated Ethical Feedback Loops" architecture.
- **Quantification Testing:** Julius to lead the validation of semantic-to-numeric mappings.
