# Briefing: ISO/IEEE Pre-Consortium Call for Comments

**To:** Global Standards Community, Academic Partners, Industry Stakeholders
**From:** QuantumPoly Governance Initiative
**Subject:** Invitation to Comment on the Open Governance Protocol (OGP) v1.0

---

## 1. Objective

QuantumPoly invites technically detailed feedback on the **Open Governance Protocol (OGP) v1.0 draft**. Our goal is to refine this specification into a robust candidate for submission to **ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42** and the **IEEE Standards Association**.

## 2. Context

As AI systems move from experimental to critical infrastructure, the need for a unified, interoperable layer for ethical governance is paramount. Proprietary "black box" safety rails are insufficient for public trust. The OGP proposes a standard for **verifiable, ledger-based governance** that ensures transparency without compromising IP or privacy.

## 3. Areas for Review

We specifically request feedback on:

1.  **Schema Interoperability:** Are the `OGP-L-01` (Ledger) and `OGP-A-01` (Audit) JSON schemas compatible with existing enterprise logging standards?
2.  **Cryptographic Overhead:** Validation of the proposed Merkle tree structure and ZK-proof implementation for real-time inference constraints.
3.  **Regulatory Alignment:** Gaps between OGP specifications and the implementation requirements of the **EU AI Act** and **NIST AI RMF**.

## 4. Timeline

- **T+0:** Release of OGP v1.0 Draft.
- **T+3 Months:** Deadline for initial RFC (Request for Comments).
- **T+4 Months:** Publication of "Consolidated Feedback Report."
- **T+6 Months:** Convening of the Pre-Consortium Working Group.

## 5. How to Participate

Please submit technical comments via the [Governance Standards Registry] or email `standards@quantumpoly.ai` with the subject "OGP RFC Response."
