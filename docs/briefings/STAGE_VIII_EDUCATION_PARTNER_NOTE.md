Partners,

As we prepare for the transition to **Stage VIII (2026–2027)**, we are introducing **Block 12.1: Education & Certification Strategy**. This initiative bridges the gap between our current federated compliance model and the upcoming era of **Adaptive Governance**.

**Key Update:**
We are launching a **"Governance Learning Hub"** prototype to help your teams navigate:

1.  **Reflexive Ethics:** How to audit systems that update their own rules.
2.  **Temporal Accountability:** Interpreting long-term ethical trajectory reports (generated by the new Temporal Ethics Kernel).

**Action Required:**
Please review the attached strategy (`BLOCK12.1_EDUCATION_STRATEGY.md`). We will begin piloting the **Governance Practitioner Certification** in Q3 2026. This certification will utilize our existing **Ethical Integrity Index (EII)** as the rubric for verifying human competence.

We invite your feedback on the proposed curriculum framework.

Best,

Julius
Implementation Lead | QuantumPoly
