## Executive Summary

As we transition into **Stage VIII (Adaptivity & Education)**, QuantumPoly is expanding its mandate from internal governance to public scientific transparency. We are pleased to announce the strategic definition of **Block 12.2 – The Public Ethics Observatory**.

This initiative, colloquially known as the **"Atlas of AI Integrity,"** transforms our existing transparency logs into a **globally accessible, research-grade observatory**. It will serve as a permanent public interface for verifying the ethical performance of our federated AI ecosystem.

## Key Capabilities for Partners

1.  **Scientific Citability:**  
    Your node's ethical performance data will now be formatted for academic citation. The Observatory's publication pipeline generates DOI-ready datasets, allowing your organization to publish verified evidence of ethical compliance in peer-reviewed journals.

2.  **Global Benchmarking:**  
    The **Ethical Integrity Index (EII)** is being extended to support cross-institutional comparison. Partners will be able to benchmark their governance metrics against the federated average, providing clear KPIs for internal ESG reporting.

3.  **Cryptographic Verification:**  
    All public data is anchored in the **Transparency Ledger** with dual-signatures and SHA-256 provenance hashes. This ensures that the "Atlas" remains a trustless source of truth—auditable by anyone, manipulable by no one.

## Implementation Timeline

- **Q2 2026:** Beta launch of the `/observatory` dashboard.
- **Q3 2026:** Public release of the `/api/observatory/global` endpoint.
- **Q1 2027:** Publication of the first "Annual Integrity Report."

## Action Required

Please review `BLOCK12.2_PUBLIC_ETHICS_OBSERVATORY.md` for the full strategic overview. We invite feedback on the **Data Governance Standards** for cross-node publication (see "Open Questions") to ensuring that transparency does not compromise proprietary node logic.
