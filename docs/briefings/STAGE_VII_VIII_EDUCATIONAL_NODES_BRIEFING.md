# Partner Briefing: Stage VII–VIII Educational Nodes

**Date:** 2025-11-23  
**Status:** Draft / For Partner Review  
**Reference:** Block 12.1 (Education & Certification Layer)

## Executive Summary

This briefing outlines the role of **Educational Nodes** within the QuantumPoly Federation (Stage VII) and their critical function in enabling **Adaptive Governance** (Stage VIII). We invite select federation partners (Universities, Ethics Boards, Research Institutes) to become founding operators of these specialized nodes.

## 1. The Concept: Educational Nodes

Unlike standard "Validator Nodes" which verify transaction integrity, **Educational Nodes** are dedicated to **verifying human competence**. They serve as the "Epistemic Bridge" between the autonomous governance system and human operators.

### Core Functions:

- **Curriculum Hosting:** Deploying the "Governance Learning Hub" (simulated environments) for local training.
- **Certification Authority:** Issuing cryptographically signed "Verifiable Credentials" (VCs) for QuantumPoly Certified Practitioners.
- **Research Feedback:** Contributing anonymized "Ethical Decay" data from simulations back to the central research kernel.

## 2. Integration with Roadmap

- **Stage VII (Federation):** Educational Nodes join the **Collective Ethics Graph** (Block 9.6), establishing a "Web of Trust" for human accreditation. A certificate issued by a University Partner is recognized instantly by a Corporate Partner node.
- **Stage VIII (Adaptivity):** As the system evolves into **Reflexive Ethics**, Educational Nodes provide the "competence check" required before an operator is allowed to authorize a self-modification of the system.

## 3. Partner Requirements

To operate an Educational Node, a partner must:

1.  **Ledger Integrity:** Run a verified instance of the Transparency Ledger (Block 10.2).
2.  **Curriculum Alignment:** Adopt the **Block 12.1 Curriculum Blueprint** (Path 1, 2, or 3).
3.  **Federated Identity:** Integrate with the **Federated Accreditation API** to issue on-chain certificates.

## 4. Value Proposition for Partners

- **Early Access:** Shape the definition of "Reflexive Ethical Competence" standards (EU AI Act alignment).
- **Research Data:** Access to high-fidelity, privacy-safe data on how humans interact with adaptive ethical systems.
- **Leadership:** Position your institution as a primary certifying body for the next generation of AI governance.

## 5. Next Steps

- Review the **Block 12.1 Curriculum Blueprint**.
- Express interest in the **H1 2026 Pilot Program**.
- Join the **Curriculum Council** (First meeting: Jan 2026).
