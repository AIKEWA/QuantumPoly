# Briefing: Trans-Disciplinary Standards Group (TDSG) Formation

**Date:** [Post-2027 Timeline]
**Status:** Chartering Phase

---

## 1. Mission

The **Trans-Disciplinary Standards Group (TDSG)** is the human oversight body tasked with guiding the evolution of the Open Governance Protocol (OGP). Its mandate is to ensure that the technical standards of the OGP reflect diverse human values, legal realities, and social needs, preventing the protocol from becoming a purely technocratic instrument.

## 2. Composition

The TDSG will be composed of 12-15 members representing three core pillars (The "Triangle of Trust"):

### Pillar A: Technology & Architecture (33%)

- Senior AI Architects
- Cryptographers
- Systems Engineers
- _Role:_ Ensure technical feasibility, security, and scalability.

### Pillar B: Ethics, Law & Society (33%)

- Moral Philosophers / Ethicists
- Legal Scholars (Human Rights, Digital Law)
- Sociologists / Anthropologists
- _Role:_ Evaluate the social impact of standards; interpret "fairness" and "accountability" in computational contexts.

### Pillar C: Civil Society & Advocacy (33%)

- Consumer Rights Advocates
- Labor Representatives
- Global South Representatives
- _Role:_ Ensure the protocol serves the public interest and protects marginalized groups.

## 3. Core Responsibilities

1.  **Review OGP RFCs:** Provide non-technical impact assessments for all proposed protocol changes.
2.  **Define "Ethical Primitives":** Consensus on how abstract concepts (e.g., "Privacy") map to technical specifications (e.g., "k-anonymity thresholds").
3.  **Veto Power:** The TDSG holds veto power over any standard update that fails the "Human Rights Impact Assessment."

## 4. Immediate Actions

- **Nomination Process:** Open call for nominations [Link].
- **Charter Drafting:** Establish bylaws and voting procedures (Quadratic Voting recommended).
- **First Convening:** Scheduled for Q3 2029 to ratify the OGP v1.0 candidate.
