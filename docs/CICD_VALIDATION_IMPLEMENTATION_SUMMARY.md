- Explained npm caching strategy (60s → 15s improvement)
- Annotated artifact retention periods (30/90 days governance)
- Justified concurrency control approach
- Documented parallel job execution strategy
- Added inline comments for each of 8 jobs explaining purpose

**Example Annotations:**

```yaml
# Node version rationale: 20.x is current LTS (active until April 2026)
# - Receives security updates and bug fixes
# - Compatible with Next.js 14.x and all dependencies
# - 18-month support window ensures stability
# Cache strategy: npm cache dramatically reduces install time (60s → 15s)
```

#### `.github/workflows/release.yml` (Enhanced)

**Changes:**

- Added deployment architecture rationale header
- Documented three critical reasons for separation from ci.yml
- Explained Vercel CLI choice vs. vercel/action
- Annotated two-key approval system (tag + release + human)
- Documented environment isolation strategy
- Explained ledger integration timing and purpose
- Added comments for GPG signature integration points

**Example Annotations:**

```yaml
# TWO-KEY APPROVAL SYSTEM:
# - Technical gate: Git tag with semantic version (v*.*.*)
# - Governance gate: GitHub Release (legal/governance approval)
# - Human gate: Manual approval in GitHub Environment
# This prevents single-person deployment mistakes and ensures oversight.
