# ADR-004: Lighthouse & A11y CI

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Authors:** Professor Doctor Julius Prompto (AI Assistant)

## Context

The QuantumPoly project requires quantifiable, automated quality gates for accessibility, performance, and SEO to ensure consistent user experience and legal compliance. Manual quality checks are prone to inconsistency and do not scale with development velocity.

### Problems Addressed:
- **Accessibility Regressions**: No automated detection of a11y violations
- **Performance Drift**: Gradual degradation of application performance
- **SEO Consistency**: Search engine optimization metrics vary between releases
- **Compliance Risk**: Potential WCAG 2.1 AA violations reaching production
- **Quality Visibility**: No quantified metrics for stakeholder reporting

## Decision

Implement **Lighthouse CI** with strict accessibility requirements and **Storybook accessibility testing** as mandatory quality gates in the CI/CD pipeline.

### Quality Gates:
1. **Accessibility Score = 1.0** (Required - failures block deployment)
2. **Performance Score ≥ 0.9** (Warning - below threshold generates alerts)
3. **SEO Score ≥ 0.9** (Warning - tracked for optimization opportunities)
4. **Best Practices Score ≥ 0.9** (Warning - ensures modern development standards)

### Testing Strategy:
- **Lighthouse CI**: Runs against deployed preview URLs (not localhost)
- **Storybook A11y**: Component-level accessibility testing using `@storybook/addon-a11y`
- **Dual Coverage**: Application-level and component-level accessibility validation

## Technical Implementation

### Lighthouse CI Configuration (`.lighthouserc.js`):
```javascript
export default {
  ci: {
    collect: { numberOfRuns: 2 },
    assert: {
      assertions: {
        "categories:accessibility": ["error", { minScore: 1.0 }],
        "categories:performance": ["warn", { minScore: 0.9 }],
        "categories:seo": ["warn", { minScore: 0.9 }],
        "categories:best-practices": ["warn", { minScore: 0.9 }],
      },
    },
    upload: { target: "temporary-public-storage" },
  },
};
```

### Storybook A11y Integration:
- `@storybook/addon-a11y` for visual accessibility feedback
- `@storybook/test` for automated a11y test execution
- Component-level testing with immediate developer feedback

### CI/CD Integration:
1. **Preview Workflow**: Lighthouse runs against live Vercel deployments
2. **Main CI**: Storybook a11y tests run as mandatory gate
3. **Failure Handling**: Accessibility failures block PR merging
4. **Reporting**: Results posted to PR comments with actionable insights

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Zero A11y Regressions**: Strict 1.0 accessibility score prevents violations
- **Performance Awareness**: Continuous monitoring prevents performance drift
- **Developer Education**: Immediate feedback improves a11y knowledge
- **Compliance Assurance**: Automated WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checking
- **Quality Metrics**: Quantified data for stakeholder reporting

### Negative:
- **Development Friction**: Failed builds require immediate a11y fixes
- **Learning Curve**: Developers must understand accessibility principles
- **Build Time**: Additional CI time for Lighthouse and Storybook testing
- **Tool Maintenance**: Keeping testing tools and thresholds updated

### Mitigations:
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive a11y guidelines and fix patterns
- **Training**: Regular accessibility training sessions for development team
- **Tooling**: IDE extensions and pre-commit hooks for early detection
- **Support**: Accessibility expert consultation for complex issues

## Quality Standards

### Accessibility Requirements:
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Minimum standard for all components
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full application accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators and logical tab order

### Performance Benchmarks:
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s on 3G network
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s on 3G network
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3.5s on 3G network

### Testing Coverage:
- **Component Level**: Every Storybook story tested for a11y
- **Application Level**: Key user journeys tested via Lighthouse
- **Cross-Browser**: Testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile Responsive**: Testing on mobile viewport sizes

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Automated Reporting:
- Lighthouse reports uploaded to temporary public storage
- PR comments include performance and accessibility scores
- Failed builds include specific remediation guidance
- Historical trends tracked for performance regression analysis

### Dashboard Integration:
- Quality metrics integrated into project dashboards
- Weekly accessibility and performance reports
- Alert system for score degradation trends
- Integration with project management tools for issue tracking

## Emergency Procedures

### A11y Failure Response:
1. **Immediate**: Block deployment until fixed
2. **Investigation**: Identify specific accessibility violations
3. **Remediation**: Implement fixes with accessibility expert guidance
4. **Verification**: Re-run tests to confirm resolution
5. **Documentation**: Update guidelines to prevent similar issues

### Performance Degradation:
1. **Warning Level**: Create issue for optimization investigation
2. **Tracking**: Monitor trends across multiple builds
3. **Optimization**: Implement performance improvements
4. **Validation**: Confirm improvements via subsequent builds

## Success Criteria

1. **Zero Accessibility Violations**: All deployments maintain 1.0 accessibility score
2. **Performance Consistency**: 95% of builds meet performance thresholds
3. **Developer Adoption**: 100% of components include a11y testing
4. **Compliance Assurance**: Automated verification of WCAG 2.1 AA standards
5. **Quality Transparency**: Stakeholders have real-time access to quality metrics
