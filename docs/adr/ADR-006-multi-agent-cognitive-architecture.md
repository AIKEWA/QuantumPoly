# ADR-006: Multi-Agent Cognitive Architecture for AI-Supported Development

## Status
**Accepted** - 2025-09-11

## Context

The QuantumPoly project serves as a "showcase for technological excellence" and "testing ground for AI-supported development" as stated in the MASTERPLAN.md vision. As we advance beyond foundational implementation (Blocks 1-2), we need to establish architectural patterns for integrating multiple AI agents and cognitive systems that can collaborate effectively in software development workflows.

Current landscape analysis:
- AI development tools (Cursor, GitHub Copilot) provide single-agent assistance
- Complex software tasks often require multiple specialized cognitive capabilities
- Need for transparent, auditable AI decision-making in production systems
- Requirement for human-AI collaboration patterns that maintain control and understanding

## Decision

We will implement a **Multi-Agent Cognitive Architecture (MACA)** framework that enables coordinated AI agent collaboration while maintaining human oversight and transparent decision-making processes.

### 1. Architecture Principles

**Cognitive Separation of Concerns:**
- **Analyst Agent**: Code analysis, pattern recognition, architecture assessment
- **Generator Agent**: Code generation, boilerplate creation, implementation
- **Reviewer Agent**: Quality assurance, best practice validation, security review
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Task coordination, workflow management, human interaction

**Human-Centric Control:**
- All agent actions require explicit human approval for production changes
- Transparent decision trails with reasoning documentation
- Fallback mechanisms for human intervention at any stage
- Clear responsibility boundaries between human and agent decisions

### 2. Technical Implementation Framework

**Agent Communication Protocol:**
```typescript
interface AgentMessage {
  from: AgentType;
  to: AgentType[];
  content: AgentRequest | AgentResponse;
  reasoning: string;
  confidence: number; // 0-1 scale
  requiresHumanReview: boolean;
  metadata: {
    timestamp: ISO8601String;
    traceId: string;
    dependencies: string[];
  };
}
```

**Workflow Orchestration:**
- Event-driven architecture with message queues
- Async agent communication with timeout handling
- State management for complex multi-step operations
- Rollback capabilities for failed agent interactions

### 3. Cognitive Agent Specializations

**Analyst Agent Capabilities:**
- Codebase pattern recognition and architectural analysis
- Dependency impact assessment
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Security vulnerability detection
- Code quality metrics and technical debt analysis

**Generator Agent Capabilities:**
- Component scaffolding and boilerplate generation
- Test case generation based on specifications
- Documentation generation from code analysis
- Configuration file creation and updates
- Migration script generation

**Reviewer Agent Capabilities:**
- Code review automation with best practice validation
- Accessibility compliance checking
- Performance impact analysis
- Security review and threat modeling
- Style guide and convention enforcement

**Orchestrator Agent Capabilities:**
