# ADR-001: CI/CD Pipeline via GitHub Actions

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** QuantumPoly Block 2 - CI/CD & Integration Tests Implementation

## Context

The QuantumPoly project needed an automated CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and maintain consistent builds across all environments. The existing codebase had components that were "locally correct" but lacked system-level verification.

## Decision

Implement a comprehensive GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with the following stages:

### 1. **Core Pipeline Steps**
- **Lint**: ESLint with Next.js configuration for code quality
- **Type Check**: TypeScript compilation without emit for type safety
- **Test Coverage**: Jest with coverage reporting for comprehensive testing
- **Build Verification**: Next.js production build to catch build-time issues
- **Storybook Build**: Component documentation and visual regression testing

### 2. **Multi-Job Architecture**
- **Main Build & Test Job**: Core validation pipeline
- **Security Job**: npm audit and dependency checks for PRs
- **Integration Tests Job**: Isolated integration test execution
- **Preview Job**: Deployment preview for pull requests

### 3. **Quality Gates**
- **Concurrency Control**: Cancel in-progress workflows for efficiency
- **Node.js 20**: Use latest LTS for optimal performance and security
- **Artifact Storage**: Preserve build outputs for debugging and deployment
- **Coverage Integration**: Codecov integration for coverage tracking

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Automated Quality Assurance**: Every commit and PR is automatically validated
- **Fast Feedback**: Developers receive immediate feedback on code quality issues
- **Consistent Builds**: Reproducible builds across all environments
- **Security Monitoring**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Documentation**: Storybook builds ensure component documentation stays current

### Negative
- **CI Cost**: GitHub Actions minutes consumption for complex workflows
- **Complexity**: Multiple jobs require careful coordination and dependency management
- **Maintenance**: CI configuration requires ongoing updates as project evolves

### Neutral
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs familiarity with GitHub Actions workflows
- **Debug Overhead**: Failed CI runs require investigation and fixing

## Implementation Details

### Workflow Triggers
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
```

### Key NPM Scripts Added
- `type-check`: TypeScript validation without compilation
- `test:integration`: Isolated integration test execution
- `validate`: Combined lint, type-check, and test execution
- `ci`: Full CI pipeline simulation for local testing

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Jenkins**: Rejected due to infrastructure overhead and maintenance complexity
2. **CircleCI**: Rejected due to cost and unnecessary features for current scale
3. **GitLab CI**: Rejected as project is hosted on GitHub
4. **Local-only Validation**: Rejected due to inconsistent developer environments

## Monitoring & Success Metrics

- **Build Success Rate**: Target >95% successful builds
- **Build Duration**: Target <10 minutes for full pipeline
- **Coverage Threshold**: Maintain >80% test coverage
- **Security Alerts**: Zero high-severity vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Future Enhancements

- **Performance Testing**: Add Lighthouse CI for performance regression detection
- **Visual Regression**: Integrate Chromatic or Percy for component visual testing
- **Deployment Automation**: Automated deployment to staging/production environments
- **Notification Integration**: Slack/Teams notifications for build failures
