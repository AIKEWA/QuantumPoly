## Changelog Maintenance Workflow

### Step 1: Update Unreleased Section (Continuous)

**When:** After every PR merge to `main`

**Who:** PR author or merge approver

**Process:**

```bash
# Edit CHANGELOG.md
# Add entry under [Unreleased] section
# Categorize appropriately (Added/Changed/Fixed/etc.)

git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs: update changelog for PR #123"
git push origin main
```

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Step 2: Prepare Release (Pre-Tag)

**When:** Before creating Git tag for release

**Who:** Release manager or DevOps lead

**Process:**

```bash
# 1. Move [Unreleased] changes to new version section
# 2. Add version number and date
# 3. Add links at bottom of changelog

# Example diff:
# ## [Unreleased]
# (empty or new in-progress changes)
#
# ## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-21
# ### Fixed
# - Fix mobile navigation menu z-index (PR #147, fixes #146)

# 4. Commit changelog
git add CHANGELOG.md

git push origin main

# 5. Create tag
git tag v1.0.1 -m "Release v1.0.1"
git push origin v1.0.1
```

---

### Step 3: Create GitHub Release (Manual)

**When:** After tag is pushed

**Who:** Release manager with approval authority

**Process:**

1. Navigate to: Repository ‚Üí Releases ‚Üí "Draft a new release"
2. Select tag: `v1.0.1`
3. Release title: `v1.0.1 - [Release Name]`
4. Copy release notes from template (fill in details)
5. Attach any binary assets (if applicable)
6. Check "Set as latest release"
7. Click "Publish release"

**Triggers:** Publishing the release triggers production deployment workflow

---

## Changelog Verification

### Automated Checks (Proposed)

Add to CI workflow:

```yaml
- name: Verify changelog updated
  run: |
    # Check if CHANGELOG.md was modified in this PR
    git diff origin/main --name-only | grep -q "CHANGELOG.md" || {
      echo "‚ùå CHANGELOG.md not updated"
      exit 1
    }
```

---

### Manual Checks

Before approving PR with changelog changes:

- [ ] Entry in correct version section (Unreleased vs. versioned)
- [ ] Entry in correct category (Added/Changed/Fixed/etc.)
- [ ] Description clear and user-facing (not technical jargon)
- [ ] PR link included
- [ ] Issue link included (if fixing a bug)
- [ ] No duplicate entries
- [ ] Alphabetical or logical ordering within category

[1.0.1]: https://github.com/quantumpoly/quantumpoly/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1
[1.0.0]: https://github.com/quantumpoly/quantumpoly/releases/tag/v1.0.0
