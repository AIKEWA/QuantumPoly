## Abstract

This white paper details the finalized governance architecture of the QuantumPoly ecosystem as of Release v1.1. It documents the transition from a theoretical "Protocol" to a living "Culture" of ethical autonomy. With the activation of Block 16.0 (Final Certification), QuantumPoly establishes a new standard for self-regulating digital systems.

## 1. Introduction

QuantumPoly is not merely a web application; it is a demonstration of **Cognitive Governance**. By embedding ethical rules directly into the code and infrastructure (Governance-as-Code), we ensure that transparency is not an afterthought but a compile-time guarantee.

## 2. The Three Pillars

### 2.1 Radical Transparency

Every administrative action, policy change, and system event is logged in a cryptographically verifiable **Governance Ledger**. This ledger is public, immutable, and secured by Merkle proofs.

### 2.2 Continuous Integrity

The system monitors its own health. Through **Operational Monitoring (Block 16.1)**, the platform autonomously verifies its API endpoints, SSL certificates, and ethical compliance daily.

### 2.3 Ethical Autonomy

With the integration of the **EWA v2 Engine**, the system possesses the capability to analyze trust trajectories and propose governance improvements autonomously, subject to human oversight for critical decisions.

## 3. Certification & Compliance

As of Block 16.0, QuantumPoly v1.1 has achieved:

- **WCAG 2.2 Level AA Compliance**
- **GDPR & DSG Data Protection Alignment**
- **ISO 42001 AI Safety Standards (Preliminary)**

The final certification (FPP-16-04) confirmed the stability and ethical alignment of the production release.

## 4. The Federation (Stage VII)

The next phase introduces the **Collective Ethics Graph**. QuantumPoly will not stand alone but will connect with other "Educational Nodes" to form a federated network of trust.

## 5. Conclusion

QuantumPoly v1.1 represents the baseline for the future of the web—a web where trust is proven, not promised.
