# 📋 Release Review Checklist & Audit Gate

## 📌 Purpose & Scope

This checklist is a structured audit framework for ensuring safe, ethical, and compliant software releases. It is designed for maintainers, DevOps engineers, SREs, and compliance/security reviewers to assess readiness across **three critical stages**: Pre-merge, Pre-release, and Post-deployment.

- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Owners:** DevOps, Security, Product, Compliance
- **Document Location:** `/docs/review-checklist.md`
- **Related Documentation:**
  - [DNS Verification Runbook](/docs/DNS.md)
  - [CI/CD Workflows](/.github/workflows/)
  - [Governance Ledger](/governance/README.md)
- **Usage Guide:**  
  Each section must be completed before proceeding. Reviewers must provide evidence and check all items explicitly. Manual sign-off is required at the Audit Gate.

## 🔗 Integration Notes

**Automated Validation:**
This checklist is automatically validated before production deployments via the `audit-check` job in [vercel-deploy.yml](/.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml).

**Governance Ledger Sync:**
Upon successful production deployment, the sign-off matrix is automatically synchronized to the governance ledger at `/governance/ledger/releases/` via the `governance-ledger` job.

**Manual Updates:**
To manually update this checklist before a release:

1. Check applicable boxes: `[ ]` → `[x]`
2. Fill in Sign-Off Matrix with Name and Date
3. Add Evidence Table entries
4. Commit changes: `git commit -m "chore(release): Complete review checklist for vX.Y.Z"`

**Validation Command:**

```bash
bash scripts/validate-checklist.sh
```

**Expected Output (Pass):**

```
✅ Release Review Checklist Validation PASSED
Stage A: 14/14 checks complete
Stage B: 13/13 checks complete
Stage C: 12/12 checks complete
Sign-Off Matrix: 4/4 roles signed
Blockers: None active
